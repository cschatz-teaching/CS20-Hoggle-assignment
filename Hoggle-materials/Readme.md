# Hoggle starter code

This directory contains two things:

## Starter code

Starter code is provided in the form of projects for our 3 supported IDEs: CodeBlocks, Eclipse and Xcode

## Example programs

These are two *fully functional* programs, one for Windows and one for Mac.
Run these to see the intended behavior of the completed project.
