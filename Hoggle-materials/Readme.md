# Hoggle starter code

This directory contains two things:

## Starter code

Starter code is provided in the form of projects for our 3 supported IDEs: CodeBlocks, Eclipse and Xcode

## Example programs

These are two *fully functional* programs, one for Windows and one for Mac.
Run these to see the intended behavior of the completed project.

Specific notes for the Mac version:
- This consists of a small script plus a "Contents" directory.
Mac OS will likely complain with an "unidentified developer" error. This requires going into your Settings,
to the Security panel, and selecting the "Open Anyway" option. 
- The underlying graphics library used in the Mac version depends on XQuartz. You will need to install this
separately if you did not already do so for other graphics activities in class.
